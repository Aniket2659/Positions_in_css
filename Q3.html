        <h1>The Earth!!</h1>
        <P class="about">
            The Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system, and it is the only celestial body known to support life. It has a diverse and complex environment, with a wide range of ecosystems and geological features. Here are some key facts about Earth:

            Earth's atmosphere is composed of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and small amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide, argon, and trace gases. This mixture is essential for supporting life and regulating the planet's climate.

            Earth has a diverse geography, including mountains, valleys, deserts, oceans, and continents. The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, and the deepest part of the ocean is the Mariana Trench.
